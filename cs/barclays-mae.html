      <p>
        The Mortgage Application Experience (MAE) is a multi-year rebuild of Barclays’ digital mortgage platform – transforming how mortgage brokers and advisers, and direct customers, manage applications from first quote to final offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Content Design Lead for this project, I shaped how the language, logic and structure work together – creating reusable patterns for complex financial rules, simplifying eligibility and income checks, and designing error and help content that guides users with clarity and confidence. Working closely with designers and developers, I helped ensure content made a mortgage application feel as effortless as possible.

          ‘I attended a workshop with front-line staff to review the broker AIP [Agreement in Principle] system. They liked the system very much, but the element that really stood out was the excellent copy – clear language and helpful tips that made the experience feel effortless.’

        The results were clear. Application times dropped from nearly an hour to under 15 minutes. Referrals to underwriters fell sharply thanks to clearer guidance and automated checks. The platform, now used by all 26,000 brokers, has seen satisfaction move from deeply negative to strongly positive – the highest levels ever recorded in broker surveys – and has helped drive record lending volumes.
